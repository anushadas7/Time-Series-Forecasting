# <p align = 'center'> Forecasting of Global Carbon Emissions and Temperature</p>

This project explores how to retrieve csv times series dataset, visualizing time series dataset, how to transform dataset into times series, testing if the time series is stationary or not using graphical and Dickey-Fuller test statistic methods, how to transform time series to stationary, how to find optimal parameters to build seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model using grid search method, diagnosing time series prediction, validating the predictive power, forecasting 10 year future CO2 emission.
